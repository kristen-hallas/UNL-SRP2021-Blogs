# Week 6
This week, I finished my F330 (WOOHOO!!) and after focusing a lot of our efforts on testing calibration, we created a final roadmap for our project!

## Flight Training

Getting my F330 flight ready was harder than it looked! It turns out that I got the CBA/YRB wires crossed a lot of different ways I didn't even expect. Then, when I downloaded Mission Planner on my system, I thought that the left/right calibration was broken. Several of us thought the roll was inverted based on the display, so we spent the afternoon troubleshooting why that could be the case. Eventually we discovered nothing was off at all, and what we saw was actually the expected / desired behavior :')

At least we made s'mores with the soldering gun, kudos to Santiago!

## My Project



To start off the week, we had a great talk from Dr. Tran about the research process. He told us we needed to be disciplined like a monk if we wanted to continue research. I appreciated that comparison a lot. No matter what's going on around you, the roadblocks preventing results, or juggling other responsibilities, the ability to remain calm and disciplined pays massive dividends. All of the presentations we had were very interesting - the one on Wednesday shared a famous movie quote and related it to a networking ice breaker. I won't forget it!

As for our project specifics, we tested more calibration, focusing more heavily on natural feature calibration so we could achieve depth recognition. That didn't work so well with the Hubsans, so Alisha said we need to try flying a bigger drone. When we tried that, we noticed some glasses have a glare - mine did, but Grace's did not - and it seems like no matter what we did, we could not get the perfect match up between fixations and our AOI. That means we may need to either a) rethink our calibration approach or b) work with bounding boxes around our AOI to make conclusions about the fixations. Furthermore, a lot of our focus has been on the Pupil Core, not Pupil Invisible - so we are in the works of determining if that will be our main focus, or if we will try both pieces of eye-tracking hardware for our study.

Over the weekend, I ate at Kasumi with a bunch of friends - a lot of us tried the sushi buffet and we were not disappointed! I drove some of them up to the Omaha Zoo for the weekend and made a stop in Council Bluffs, Iowa to watch a movie. Because why not?

July 4th was really fun too! I went to Pawnee Lake with some friends of mine, and then I got an invite to light off as many fireworks as I could at a friend's house. I genuinely lit fireworks for 5 hours straight, and had one of the best homemade brisket sandwiches I've ever eaten. Another friend did my makeup - it was absolutely the most American 4th of July I've ever experienced.

Next week, we are really excited to move forward with concrete goals, like taking our FAA 107 exams and solidifying the methodology for IRB approval. We will also focus on making annotations, drafting our poster. See you then! [Want to read about next week?](7/HallasWK7.md)
