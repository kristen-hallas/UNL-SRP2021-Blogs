# Week 5

This week, I soldered for the first time ever, started building my F330, edited my literature review, and worked through some calibration methods for Pupil Core. I also had another really fun weekend!



## Flight Training

The Hubsans keep breaking, which gave me opportunity to solder them to sanity. I soldered the first time at the start of this week. By the next day, I could show another lab member how to solder too. I like how I can both learn and teach during this experience.

Before I knew it, I had the opportunity to begin building my own drone. Actually, I got the kit on my birthday!

Building the 330 was a fun way to bond with my lab partner Grace! She showed me the best way to solder larger wires onto the board because she had previous experience doing so. I had to attach a leg temporarily to 4 spots on the circuitboard, trim and strip each wire to size, then resolder them to their respective locations.

I really like the hands-on work with the drones, so much that I decided I wanted to finish as much as I could on my 330 drone before the weekend. Alisha gave me cupcakes, which gave me the extra energy to push through :)

Anyway, because the Hubsans are broken so much I had a hard time practicing. Plus, there's a lot of other tasks to focus on too... like



## My Project


Alisha also gave me notes on my literature review :') these comments were really helpful and came around the same time Dr. Sharif made her presentation, so it gave me a lot to think about in regards to study design. I'm going to focus on describing more specifics regarding the previous related studies I found - that way, I can optimize our task flow, narrow down the data we seek to collect, and plan ahead for possible pitfalls during data collection.

We noticed a calibration issue on Wednesday. Basically, the first method and second method don't work with depth, but the third method does. We ran 6 tests, three for me and three for Grace, to demonstrate how each calibration method works for the same task. It was really fun to go through each method. We did think that there was an issue, possibly with the headset itself, but Dr. Sharif and Cole assured us we needed to practice more calibration to narrow the issue. We also got introduced to the Pupil Lab discord for further help.

Anyway, more fun stuff. A friend and I went to the Omaha Zoo! Here are some of the best pictures I took. I even got some more flight training in ;)

Wait, that last picture is actually from A Novel Idea Bookstore! They were open for Lincoln's Pineapple Days during the last week of June. It has been so much fun to shop local here. Everyone keeps commenting on how cute my outfits are, and I keep telling them, they have to come get some outfits of their own in Lincoln! By the way, my birthday was really fun too. I went to dinner at Bison Witches and saw the new Conjuring movie with some friends in the program. It was one of the best birthdays I've had, and I'm so grateful for the connections I've made here!

Next week, we will do more calibration and study design, I will finish my 330 drone and maybe even start building a 550. See you next week! [Want to read about next week?](./6/HallasWK6.md)
