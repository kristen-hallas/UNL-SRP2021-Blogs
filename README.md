# UNL-SRP2021-Blogs
I wanted somewhere to showcase the blogs I created during my time working at the NIMBUS (Nebraska Intelligent MoBile Unmanned Systems) lab. This summer research experience was so much fun and provided me a lot of clarity as to where to take my career direction. If you are an undergraduate seeking to undergo a research experience during the summer, I recommend that you apply. The program website can be found at: https://srp.unl.edu/
