# Week 4
This week, I took the first part of my Hubsan flight test, finished my literature review, tested eye-tracking data collection with Pupil Core - and if pictures are worth 1,000 words, this blog post will be worth at least 18,000! 

## Flight Training
Early in the week, Alisha gave me some flight practice tips. She recommended I started practicing shapes in the air with my Hubsan, like circles, triangles, and squares. I felt very comfortable laying the UAV low on the ground, but in the air, I was shaky. So with each practice session, I understood more about what I had to do to maintain stability and execute certain motions. For example, I realized that I had to offset the motion of a pitch movement with thrust movement. I practiced short linear distances from arbitrary points A and B, then extended the distance between these points to travel longer. This was sufficient for me to pass the first six exercises needed for passing the Hubsan flight test, woohoo!

Part of this discovery included me breaking the connection between the battery wires and the circuitboard. Fortunately, Hadley was willing to show me how to solder the two back together. It was really cool to watch her do this, as I'm interested in getting more comfortable with engineering while I'm here.

Unfortunately, my training session was cut short - but it was for good reason! We took our photos in the NIMBUS lab cage and had some awesome shots staged about our project. I wore the Pupil Invisible while looking at a drone Siya was flying, while Grace held the Android connected to my eyegear. Our mentors made an appearance in the shot as well. I can't wait to see the final result! Later this week, Alisha defended her thesis and I was so happy for her. I learned more deeply about her work in NIMBUS that I already read about for my literature review, and had the opportunity to pick her brain about it afterwards.

## My Project
Listening to her talk helped me think more about pre and post reflection survey design and different types of qualitative and quantitative data that would be useful for our study - and it made me laugh (do not pass go, do not collect $200!! and the self-pitying drone D:). I also saw the bigger picture of what my research project could contribute to, like new drones that combine together the features of eyegear, vehicular control and a sound system. These could be useful in so many industries, as the usage of drones(iDrones?) could grow just as the cellular phone did.

Another really fulfilling part of my week was sharing my research experience with some students at my local high school. I was invited by a faculty mentor at UTRGV to speak, so I prepared a video about the most fun and most accesible parts of the work being done in the NIMBUS lab. The students asked questions about my university experience - and part of my story involves being too concerned about "my image as a woman" to study STEM - so I shared about that, encouraging them to follow their dreams no matter what. Bryan joined us for a few minutes to talk about his experience on the swarm project - that was the students' favorite project they heard about, and it was cool to see Bryan so excited to talk to them. [Anyway, you can check out my video at this link if you want:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yMadkBjR4o)

If you watched the video before continuing to read my blog, your eyes may have noticed something... but let me direct your gaze back to my project. Grace and I recorded some amazing test data with the Pupil Core, that made us nearly roll on the floor laughing!

So, our mentors recommended we record something, anything, to test out Pupil Core. Grace came up with the awesome idea to make a word search. I asked if she could make it swamp related and she did!

Then, I prepared to take the "exam". I was ready! After finishing the word search in about two minutes, we looked back to see what my eye movement was doing. We were shocked to see that my eyes gazed on the words "fly" and "bug" several times, yet I did not circle it. This was such an interesting phenomenon and made us really thirst for more work on the eye-tracking portion of our project.

And now, for the fun stuff - OK, but not like this stuff isn't fun, because it definitely is - I just had even more fun over the weekend! I went to a spiritual retreat in Sparks, NE, which is about 5 hours away. I saw my first waterfall, which is the BIGGEST waterfall in Nebraska, Smith Falls. I tubed down the river for the first time and didn't get totally sunburnt like Jemin did, fortunately. And because there's no light pollution, the stars were absolutely stunning. It was a special experience I'll remember a lifetime.

Next week, we will work on recording more test data with the Pupil Core, specific to drones. Also, we will plan out our flight paths, practice enough yeehawing - I mean yawing - to pass the Hubsan flight test. I'm so excited for what's to come, can you tell? See you next week!
