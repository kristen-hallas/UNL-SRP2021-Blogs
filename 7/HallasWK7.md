# Week 7
This week, we spent most of our time trying to figure out calibration techniques with the eye-tracking portion of the project - and with an optmistic solution in sight, we pushed forward with experiment design. 

## My Project

We continued testing whether natural feature calibration could be useful for our study. Natural feature calibration on Pupil Labs software allows the user to select any location for calibration, provided it is visible in world view. The software user clicks the calibration point on Pupil Capture as the wearer of the tracker gazes at the point. We previously tested this with only a few points in the center of the cage, placing the majority on "boundary" points of the cage. So on Monday, our mentors suggested that clothespins and fishing line could be beneficial to hanging up our markers - that way, we would cover more of the middle of the cage where the drone is flying - this was a great idea, so I picked these supplies up at Walmart later that afternoon.

The clothespins are very helpful to hang markers in a way that capture varying heights in the middle of the cage. We hypothesized that the more variation in our marker placement, with respect to height and position within the cage, the more precise our calibration results could be.

Thus, throughout the week, a large portion of our time was allocated towards hanging and removing various markers :') sometimes the cage was occupied, other times the eye tracker was occupied. On Friday, we finally got the majority of test data we sought to capture!

One lesson we learned: when you move your eyes in a circle, the green circle populates sooner. That was a great takeaway for us. Siya made a suggestion to use a bigger resolution for the world camera as well, which is something we will include in our plans for next week.

The calibration method we compared to our test data for natural features calibration was single marker. We are still finalizing our collection of this data, but, the results look promising in favor of natural features! Grace will cover a lot of this in her poster. By the way - in regards to our poster, the talk that Dr. Bradley gave was super helpful for us. He gave us tips for academic writing and introduced the concept of Heilmeier's Catechism to us. I left the talk feeling very inspired to bring this knowledge to all my future academic writing.

I am also very grateful to both Santiago and Alisha this week. At the start of the week, Alisha and I talked some ideas about the poster presentation coming up, and a viable direction for our project to go in, with regards to addressing the differences between novice and expert UAV pilots. Then it so happened that Santiago wanted to fly the drone, so I suggested some possible flight paths we could try - starting with left to right, up to down, U shape, circle, figure 8, and then yaw practice. After these talks, I felt really inspired to draft an experiment checklist. Grace gave some really helpful feedback in regards to adding a square path, to complement the yaw practice task. Ultimately I'm really excited to have that in the works and collect preliminary data early next week. I plan to use Python to collect some useful charts to display on my poster.

This week I spent all my time in the beautiful city of weekend! My friends and I went to Grey Whale Sushi, Ivanna Cone, Black Widow, The Mill, East Campus for food from Chef Al, Stella Clothing, Francie and Finch Book Store, Rutabagas (to celebrate their one year anniversary of their store location!!) and the Addams Family showing at the Pinewood Bowl. It was a really special week I won't forget :)

Next week, we will finalize our calibration methods and study checklist, run data, and hopefully arrive at some preliminary results that are poster-acceptable. See you then! [Want to read about next week?](/8/HallasWK8.md)
